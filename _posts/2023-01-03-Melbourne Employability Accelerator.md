## More

The specific details have been forgotten. Our team of 4 people acts as a consulting team to provide services to a customer. The customer's private enterprise is related to seaweed products. Our team is responsible for providing consulting, including market surveys, marketing activities, etc.

And we produced a PowerPoint presentation, which we did a demo of, and a detailed report.




### Reflection

This hands-on experience was really special. It let me use the theoretical knowledge I learned at uni in real-life situations.

I was the team leader back then. I took the initiative to set up and run meetings. During this process, not only did I improve my own skills, but I also helped team members boost important abilities like communicating, solving problems, leading, working as a team, being service - minded, and understanding different cultures. This hands - on experience actually connected what I learned at school with real - world applications.

This project introduced me to machine learning and modern neural networks. It introduced the key theory of this approach and then explored the practical use of machine learning on real problems involving the classification of images, sounds and motion data. We use the online Edge Impulse platform to apply sophisticated neural network learning approaches. During the project, we choosed our own real-world classification task, developed a solution using the skills that we learned, wrote up our results, and present our work back to the group.

# Instructor Introduction

Prof. Alex Rogers

Department of Computer Science

University of Oxford

Dr. Alex is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford as well as the current Co-Director of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre for Doctoral Training (AIMS CDT) and a member of the Cyber-Physical Systems research group.

# Outcome üéâÔ∏è

On the platform of **Edge Impulse**, we did a mini research project.

## `Project Objective`

* The project aims to explore how to identify pneumonia and COVID-19 using chest X-ray images with the MobileNet model on the Edge Impulse platform.
* It provides a novel automated detection approach to reduce the workload of doctors and improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

## `Background and Motivation`

* Chest X-rays are critical for the preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia and other diseases, but traditional methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
* X-ray diagnostics can be prone to interference from overlapping organs, leading to misdiagnosis. Machine learning offers a solution to enhance diagnostic efficiency.
* The study aims to use X-ray images to screen diseases, reduce reliance on CT scans, and lower medical costs.

## `Dataset`

* A public dataset from Roboflow is used, with images resized to 416√ó416 and classified into three categories: COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia.

* Data preprocessing was conducted to address various interference types.

## `Model and Methods`

* Transfer learning techniques and the MobileNet model were employed for data classification and analysis.
* The model demonstrated an accuracy of 60-70% on a specific dataset, highlighting its feasibility for integration into mobile devices.

## `Applications and Significance`

* Provides a convenient self-testing tool for detecting lung disease patterns via mobile phones.
* Offers technical support for large-scale population screening, reducing reliance on expert diagnoses.

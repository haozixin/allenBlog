# Internship Description

**Position:** Python Developer Intern

**Location:** On-site work

**Duration:** 3 months

**Responsibilities:**

- Devised back-end logic for data analysis tools by writing Python scripts and processing large-scale chip test data in MongoDB, thereby obtaining statistical results and significantly accelerating data analysis efficiency

- Restructured the database and revised data processing logic, boosting data processing efficiency by about 10%

- Collaborated weekly with another department to confirm requirements and worked closely with one technical lead and two product leads to drive development efforts

- Skills: Python; MongoDB; Linux; PyMongo; Jupyter Notebook


## Challenges

I had to quickly learn the basics of the chip manufacturing industry and its terminology: 
fields in the database like yield rate, Wafer ID, and Lot were unfamiliar to me. Some of the requirements were also unclear because they related to the chip testing process. So, I had to quickly grasp the essential industry knowledge and terms to fully understand the requirements. I think this was the biggest challenge during my internship, but I really enjoyed learning about a different industry outside of my fieldâ€”it was quite interesting.

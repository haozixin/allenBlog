## Challenges

One key challenge I faced was realizing that understanding a concept myself was very different from being able to explain it clearly to others. Tutoring forced me to break down complex ideas into simpler, more digestible steps, which significantly sharpened my own communication and problem-solving skills.

Additionally, being highly responsible, I initially invested a great deal of time in lesson preparation to ensure I met each studentâ€™s needs. While this impacted my own schedule and other commitments at first, I gradually learned to manage my time more efficiently and strike a better balance between quality and sustainability.

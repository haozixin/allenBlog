# Company Introduction

# Internship Description

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Location:** Hybrid work
 
**Duration:** 3 months

**Responsibilities:**

- Developed back-end APIs using Django and RESTful frameworks to support the new functions in the company's application, website, and back-end management systems

- Familiarized with existing products and repository code, fixed over 300 warnings and outdated unit test errors, resulting in more robust and cleaner back-end logic

- Merged completed features into release and production branches efficiently, adhering to Git best practices and ensuring smooth deployment and integration

- Skills: Python; Django; RESTful framework; Unit test; Git; API development



## Challenges
I think the most challenging part was fixing the old unit tests. Before you can fix them, you have to understand the original business logic and what the test function is actually trying to check. I spent a lot of time digging through the codebase, looking for clues.

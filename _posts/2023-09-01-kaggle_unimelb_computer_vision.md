Computer vision project: Exploration and breakthrough of image similarity matching

Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/bobohao/competitions

## Background

The project focuses on bridging the gap between the advantages of human visual reasoning and artificial intelligence. In real-world scenarios, humans can easily recognize subtle and abstract similarities between images through intuition and experience, but the ability of computers to do this still needs to be improved. This project uses this as an entry point to develop algorithms that can accurately handle complex image similarity matching tasks.

## Requirements
The core task of the project is to build a powerful image matching algorithm. Given a set of image pair data inspired by popular entertainment websites, the training dataset contains 2000 pairs of images, the test set also has 2000 pairs, and each "left" image in the test set is associated with 20 candidate "right" images (only one is a correct match). The algorithm needs to deeply analyze various characteristics of the input image, such as color distribution and tone matching, shape contour and structural characteristics, texture delicacy and regularity, pose angle and position relationship, and subtle changes in facial expression, etc., and then accurately locate the most matching image from many candidates.


The project results submission process is strict and comprehensive. The code part needs to cover the complete implementation of the model architecture, the prediction results based on the test set (following the specific Kaggle format), and detailed documentation to ensure the reproducibility and readability of the code. The written report follows the IEEE conference short article specification. In a limited space (no more than four A4 pages, the reference can occupy a single page), the design idea, technical selection basis, experimental flow and optimization process of the project are clearly explained. Through rigorous error analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm in different types of image matching are deeply analyzed, and practical improvement directions are proposed based on a deep understanding of the principle of the algorithm. At the same time, we skillfully use tables, charts, and images to visualize experimental data and results, enhancing the persuasiveness and readability of the report.

I pubished a conference paper in 2024. Here is the link: [https://drpress.org/ojs/index.php/HSET/article/view/20596](https://drpress.org/ojs/index.php/HSET/article/view/20596)

## Paper Summary

**Paper Name:**  Comparative Analysis of Transformer Integration in U-net Networks for Enhanced

**Content Abstract:** 

This paper introduces how Transformers, originally popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP), are now being used to address the limitations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical image segmentation. By reviewing existing studies and analyzing case examples, it compares the performance of various models in this field and explains how Transformers can be integrated into U-net architectures.

The research highlights that integrating Transformers can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis. It focuses on methods of combining these models, particularly emphasizing the advantages of integrating Transformers into the encoder part of U-net. However, it also points out the need to balance performance improvements with computational costs.

Although no single model is perfect, the study concludes that by choosing the right combination of Transformer and U-net based on specific needs, optimal results can be achieved. The combination of U-shaped convolutional networks and Transformer modules shows strong potential and great significance for further research in medical imaging.

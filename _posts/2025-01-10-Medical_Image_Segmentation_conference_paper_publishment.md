I’m thrilled to have contributed as the first author! 

Here’s the gist: 💡

Kidney cancer is tricky—it’s on the rise, but early detection can save lives. We built a 3D U-Net model with some smart upgrades (like residual blocks and a cascade design) to make it way better at finding those sneaky little tumors. Tested it on the KiTS2019 challenge (a big deal in this field), and it ranked #23 on the leaderboard (https://lnkd.in/gZZPna8Z). Not too shabby for a first shot!

🙏 Huge shoutout to Brian Chapman for being an amazing mentor and guiding me through this. Couldn’t have done it without his support and insights.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, swap ideas, or just geek out about this stuff. The paper link will be up once it’s published, so stay tuned for that.

## Paper Summary

**Paper Name:**  Deep Learning-Based Cascade 3D Kidney Segmentation Method

**Content Abstract:** 

Renal tumors require early diagnosis and precise localization for effective treatment. This study aims to automate renal tumor analysis in abdominal CT images using a cascade 3D U-Net architecture for semantic kidney segmentation. To address challenges like edge detection and small object segmentation, the framework incorporates residual blocks to enhance convergence and efficiency. Comprehensive training configurations, preprocessing, and postprocessing strategies were employed to ensure accurate results. Tested on KiTS2019 data, the method ranked
23rd on the leaderboard (Nov 2024), demonstrating the enhanced cascade 3D U-Net’s effectiveness in improving segmentation precision.

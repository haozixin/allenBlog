## Challenges

One of the main challenges I faced early on was finding a working style that suited both me and the client. As we had different expectations regarding communication frequency, decision-making, and iteration cycles, it took time to align our approaches. I initiated regular check-ins and clarified deliverables to build trust and transparency. Through this process of adjustment and active listening, we eventually established a workflow that was efficient, collaborative, and comfortable for both sides.

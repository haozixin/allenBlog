## About me
My name is Zixin, I’m originally from China and completed my schooling there up until high school graduation. My passion for science began in high school, and the first time I visited Australia was as a student attending the World Science Conference in Brisbane. That experience really kicked off my connection with Australia. After that, I pursued a Bachelor of IT at Monash University, majoring in Software Development.

During my studies, both through university courses and self-learning, I picked up a range of technical skills—things like object-oriented programming, Agile development, Java, and various frameworks. In my final semester, I took part in the Industry Experience project, where my team and I developed a website for a client. We worked from the ground up, collecting the client's requirements and going through the whole Agile development process. We used the CakePHP framework to build a content management system that helped the client increase their exposure and grow their business.

Eager to continue learning, I immediately pursued a Master of IT at the University of Melbourne, focusing on AI. Because, I wanted to explore cutting-edge technologies, and I believe that having a background in AI broadens my perspective and problem-solving approach. Throughout my studies, I participated in multiple school activities and societies, like the Grand Challenge and digital industry events, to further develop my soft skills. I also earned a place on the Dean's List for 2023, which was a great recognition of my learning abilities, and I graduated with distinction. Additionally, I placed in the top 5% in several AI-related Kaggle competitions. In my final semester, I conducted academic research and completed my thesis on Medical Image Segmentation, where I designed a custom model and ranked 23rd on the （KiTS2019） Challenge leaderboard.

I’m always eager to apply what I’ve learned, so during my breaks, I managed to land two internships. The first was in Shanghai at a multinational company where I worked as a Python Developer, processing chip test data with PyMongo and writing the related technical documentation. The second was here in Melbourne at a fintech company, where I worked as a Software Engineer, focusing on backend API development and unit test debugging.

I pride myself on being curious about new things, eager to learn new skills, and having a responsible and diligent spirit.
